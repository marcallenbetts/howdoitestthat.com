If you're running tests from the same machine, there's generally no friction.</p>\n<p>But sometimes you need to share a locally running resource with a different machine that may or may not be on the same network. You can go down the rabbit hole of trying to deploy to a publicly available site, or go the easy route and set up a tunnel to your local machine.</p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://ngrok.com/\">ngrok</a>. This is a service that allows you to open up a port on your local machine and make it publicly available.</p>\n<p>To install: <code class=\"language-text\">npm install -g ngrok</code></p>\n<p>You need to create a free account with ngrok, but they support both Github and Google auth so you can be up and running in just a few minutes. After logging in, running ngrok with a protocol and a port number will give you a publicly facing URL that is valid for 24 hours. (I'm pretty sure they have paid versions with more flexibility, but I haven't need that yet.)</p>\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ngrok http 8081</code></p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ngrok help</code></p>","id":"74e2a949-81ea-5b9e-a13e-f749dec12ac4","frontmatter":{"title":"ngrok","date":"December, 2018","tags":["ngrok","network"]},"fields":{"slug":"/ngrok/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"tag":"network"}}
