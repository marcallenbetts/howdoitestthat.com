It's 2018 and I decided to start a blog. Which is odd because as far as I'm concerned blogging died in
2013 when Google pulled the plug on Reader.

I'm doing this mostly to collect the ever growing pile of miscellaneous tipes and tricks that I use in my
day-to-day software testing efforts. I don't intend this to be another general purpose software testing blog.
There will be no posts about how to write a defect report. No discussion about whether or not to automate tests. 
No talk about how to find good testers.

I don't have the interest in talking about why we test or who should test. I'm here to talk about how to test.
