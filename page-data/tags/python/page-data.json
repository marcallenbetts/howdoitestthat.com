Unless you count \"Python? That's the one that's really picking about spacing, right?\"</p>\n<p>A few years back I worked on a system that did web scraping for content. So when testing that we were gathering web pages correctly, it was useful to have a web server up and running. Being generally lazy, I opted for the path of least resistance: use web servers that other people maintained for me.</p>\n<p>So I had countless free hosting accounts with all the shadiest free hosting outfits a Google search would return. Most of which would disappear without a trace a few months later.</p>\n<p>Later, one of the devs introduced me to Python's SimpleHTTPServer. It's pretty much what the name implies. A simple http server that will serve up static content to GET requests. This is also my goto for quickly mocking or modding an API response for a web page or a mobile app.</p>\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">python -mSimpleHTTPServer 8081</code></p>","id":"8d7bc656-5acc-5442-8feb-71836bcc1be9","frontmatter":{"title":"Python SimpleHTTPServer","date":"December, 2018","tags":["python","webserver"]},"fields":{"slug":"/python-simple-http-server/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"python"}},"staticQueryHashes":["392256161","551055924","63159454"]}
